# Unity UFO Game
The task was to build a new game by extending the UFO example game you built during workshops.
Many requirements and features of the game are pre-defined (below), but within those parameters
we were free to add components, game mechanics, and ideas, in order to produce a fun and well polished game experience.

Eliciting and using feedback from players was an important part of the game creation proess.
We had to follow a specific and structured process for collecting user feedback, and to explain how the feedback
was used to improve the game.

Required game features:
The game had to extend the original UFO game by adding the following features:
- The game should have enemies which can be shot and killed.
- There should be more than one kind of enemy.
- The playing area had to be extended.
- Enemies should be able to attack and kill the player.
- An game end condition had to be clearly defined.
- The game had to increase in difficulty as play develops.
